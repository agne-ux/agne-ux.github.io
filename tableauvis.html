						<p>The visualisation uses data published by The Committee to Protect Journalists and can be found <a href="https://cpj.org/data/methodology/">here</a>. It includes cases of journalists that have been killed, imprisoned or reported missing since 1992. The database is updated annually.</p>
						<p>Prior to implementation, the data was cleaned and transformed with SQL and Tableau Prep.</p>

							<p class= "section">USER GOAL AND QUESTIONS</p>
						</div>
						<div class= "right-text">
						   <p>The design of the visual assumes that the user's main goal is to discover the data, meaning  for some trends and patterns, trying to generate and verify a hypothesis. Accordingly, visualisation enables users to answer open-ended questions, such as which countries have the highest journalist imprisoment rates, how events of interest effect the safety journalists, which countries are unsafe for foreign media to work in etc. The user goal and anticipated questions informed the design of the visualisation, its structure and interactive features.</p>
						   <p>In line with the user goal, the visualisation follows Shneiderman's data visualisation principle. First, it provides an overview of the data, helping users to orient themselves. Then, users can use time, country, category filters to zoom in on the data of their interest. More details can be accessed via tooltips.</p>

						<p>Due to the limitations of the software changes had to be made to orginal design ideas and some work arounds had to be used, such as layering diferent graphs, which affected the usability of the filters.</p>

						<p>1. In the global overview map and the line graph,  Turkey stands out as the country with the highest amount of cases. Comparison of the global and Turkey's trend lines indicates that Turkey shapes the global trend.</p>

						<p>2. Upon a visual inspection of the line graph and an application of the country filter (Turkey) it becomes clear that the overall number of cases since 2016 jumped from 1 to 68. This allows to infer that some significant event occured in Turkey in 2016. This event was a failed coup attempt staged against the Turskish president Erdogan in July.</p>

						<p>3. Experimenting with the application of missed/ killed/imprisoned category filters shows that all case since 2016 are imprisonment. This reflects mass arrests carried by the Turkish goverment after the coup attempt.<p>
