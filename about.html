						My professional UX journey started three years ago when as a social anthropology graduate I was looking for a field where I could utilise my versatile research skills. My first role in the UX field was as a UX research trainee at an agency Ad Hoc Global where I worked on projects centred around redesigning UK public services online. In this role, I have gained exposure to all stages of UX research and familiarised myself with industry standards. Afterwards, I was able to apply these skills when working in a digital ad technology company  Adfrom where I independently designed and run UX research and usability studies.

						Recently, I have completed a master's degree in human-computer interaction at the University of St. Andrews. During the course I have aquired a range of practical skills in designing interactive computer systems. The course covered modules such as User-Centered Design, Information Visualisation, Web Development,  Human-Computer Interaction, Javascript, Software Engineering Princinples and Processes. My thesis project involvolved conducting eye tracking experiments in order to examine culturally determined perceptional differences of users viewing web and mobile app interfaces.
